# Causal-Inference-Epidemic

Feel free to edit this with your ideas


done:
1. Implemented the SIR on simulated networks with different structures including the BA model and its configuration network that preserves the same degree distribution. Compared that with a completely random Erdos Renyi network.
2. Experimented with running the SIR on the Watts Strogatz with different parameter settings. An observable trend is that as the network becomes more randomised, the epidemic takes off sooner
3. Implemented a Core-Peripheral structured network

To do suggestions:

to start with
1. Find covid19 parameters applicable to the SIR with reference, e.g. reproduction number, average recovering time and average incubation time
2. Find applicable network data, suggestions: commuter network
3. Implement this in pyro. 

Problem: Work done so far are not in any way related to covid19.
